My learning was focused on making a simple UI, a smooth UX, and having a toggle for dark-mode. 

## Optimizations

When I improve this project, I would start by saving the theme preference in local storage. That way users won't have to toggle each time they visit. I would also like to use Javascript to turn the image into a gif on hover.

## Lessons Learned:

It's much more convenient to use CSS variables for your colors. When I was adding the dark mode toggle, I had to search through my CSS for each color. I compiled the colors into a small list of CSS variables for easy access. The colors were no longer scatterd accross. If I wanted to change colors, all I had to do was change one line, or in this case, a click of a button.
